## What is KAP?
Korikas Avatar Plugin (KAP) is a huge collection of tools for making VRChat avatars!
It manages your projects structure, generates animations, copies contents from avatar to avatar and will have a lot of other features in the future...

### current features:
- generating folders, animations, overrides and scenes for your avatar
- automatic visemes on your model
- easily setting up the viewpoint, with a gameobject
- generating a beat based animation with the beatfinder tool of audacity and KAP
- playing any animation of the avatars override in play-mode
- listing your avatars, that you have KAP-imported and see their performance statistics
- delete avatars, open their scene or clean/locate their folder in the avatars list
- hand-collider adding through UI with a possability to change the size and see their size in realtime
- automatic collider adding to every dynamic bone on the model

### future implementations:
- automatic sdk updater, that can be toggled

## How to contribute
You can contribute by creating issues for this repository or by joining our [discord](https://discord.gg/z2SmFqg) and telling me there what problem/ideas you have.
## Where are the ideas coming from?
I really fell in love with VRChat based unity tools and thats why I am trying to gather them all into one usefull plugin. Thats the reason, why you will find some features in other projects based on VRChat! That doesnt mean, that I steal code. Everything within this project is self-implemented and I wish, that where was some kind of way, to show you that Im not stealing your credentails!
## How do I use it?
There will be a tutorial!
### installation
- download the latest version [here](https://github.com/KorikaDEV/KorikasAvatarPlugin/releases)!
- drag and drop it into your Unity project
### requirements
- VRChats SDK
- Dynamic Bones
